# [bblackmoor/obsidian](https://github.com/bblackmoor/obsidian)
Template, markdown, and other files intended for use with Obsidian.

## Requirements

* Obsidian [https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)
* Folder Notes [https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes)
* Templater [https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
* Waypoint [https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint (optional)](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint) (optional)

## Breadcrumbs

I organize my notebook like so:

* Notebook
  * Top Level Section
    * Subsection
      * etc.
  * Top Level Section
    * Subsection
      * etc.

I want breadcrumbs to:

* only show the "Notebook" breadcrumb on the "Top Level Section" pages
* if viewing the folder note, do not show the current folder in the breadcrumbs

You can see the desired result in these files:

* [``Notebook/Notebook.md``](https://github.com/bblackmoor/obsidian/tree/main/Notebook)
* [``Notebook/Assets/Assets.md``](https://github.com/bblackmoor/obsidian/tree/main/Notebook/Assets)
* [``Notebook/Assets/Templates/Templates.md``](https://github.com/bblackmoor/obsidian/tree/main/Notebook/Assets/Templates)

## Month Templates

I create calendars for each month, with each day being a link to that journal's day. I have included the LibreOffice Calc file I use to generate the markdown calendar:

* [``journal_templates.ods``](https://github.com/bblackmoor/obsidian/tree/main)

I have also included an example journal file:

* [``Notebook\Journal\2024\2024-01 January\2024-01-01.md``](https://github.com/bblackmoor/obsidian/tree/main/Notebook/Journal/2024/2024-01%20January)
