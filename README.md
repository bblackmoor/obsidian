# bblackmoor/obsidian
Template, markdown, and other files intended for use with Obsidian.

## Requirements

* Obsidian https://obsidian.md/
* Folder Notes https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes
* Templater https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater
* Waypoint https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint (optional)

## Breadcrumbs

I organize my notebook like so:

* Notebok
  * Top Level Section
    * Subsection
      * etc.
  * Top Level Section
    * Subsection
      * etc.

I want breadcrumbs to:

* only show the "Notebook" breadcrumb on the "Top Level Section" pages
* do not show the folder note in the breadcrumbs

You can see the desired result in the ``Notebook.md`` file, the ``Assets.md`` file and the ``Templates.md`` file.
