# bblackmoor/obsidian
Template, markdown, and other files intended for use with Obsidian.

## Requirements

* Obsidian https://obsidian.md/
* Folder Notes https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes
* Templater https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater
* Waypoint https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint (optional)

## Breadcrumbs

I organize my notebook like so:

* Notebok
  * Top Level Section
    * Subsection
      * etc.
  * Top Level Section
    * Subsection
      * etc.

I want breadcrumbs to:

* only show the "Notebook" breadcrumb on the "Top Level Section" pages
* if viewing the folder note, do not show the current folder in the breadcrumbs

You can see the desired result in these files:

* ``Notebook/Notebook.md``
* ``Notebook/Assets/Assets.md``
* ``Notebook/Assets/Templates/Templates.md``

## Month Templates

I create calendars for each month, with each day being a link to that journal's day. I have included the LibreOffice Calc file I use to generate the markdown calendar:

* ``journal_templates.ods``

I have also included an example journal file:

* ``Notebook\Journal\2024\2024-01 January\2024-01-01.md``
